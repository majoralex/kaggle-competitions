# Kaggle Competiton #1: Titanic
The purpose of this project was to understand the thought process of working through a Machine Learning problem and to correctly predict whether someone survided the Titanic shipwreck. I used [Ken Jee's ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I3FBJdiExcg&ab_channel=KenJee) and [Daniel Bourke's](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1y9wDDxWnA&ab_channel=DanielBourke) Titanic tutorials as my main point of reference. I included some of my preferred methods of EDA, but relied on the tutorials to guide me through the training and fitting portions of the project.
